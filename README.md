## COEN313 Digital Design II

### Course description

In this course, students are exposed to a comprehensive overview of VHDL language and the synthesis process for the design of digital systems.
First, students learn the hardware implementation of basic VHDL language constructs, then they are exposed to the core of the RT-level design, including combinational circuits, "regular" sequential circuits, finite state machines, and circuits designed using register transfer methodology.
Students are introduced as well to concepts related to metastability, self-timed circuits, programmable logic devices, field programmable gate arrays and testing issues.
